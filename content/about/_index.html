<p><center>One is not born into the world to do everything but to do something.<br>– Henry David Thoreau</center></p>

<p><center>Welcome</center></p>

<p>I'm Brad and this website is a collection of things that I'm doing and passionate about. I recently started a guided meditation series, the first of which can be accessed <a href="/img/audio/2020-11-16-meditation.mp3" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    
<p>I’m passionate about education, <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/classic/" target="_blank">digital privacy</a> and data science. I'm currently a Data Engineer for Aegon in The Hague, Holland - any work-related stuff you can find on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-carruthers-7b737190/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, and there are still some (outdated) things on <a href="https://github.com/BCallumCarr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
    
<p>Some of my favourite things to do are surfing, teaching, public speaking, <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com" target="blank_">playing Dungeons and Dragons</a> and travelling (pre-COVID evidently).</p>
        
<p> It would make my day if you reached out to me to chat about any of the above, or anything else really: <a href="mailto:brad@securewealth.co.za">bcallumcarr{at}protonmail{dot}com</a>.</p>

<!-- <p>Last but definitely not least, I must thank Bronwyn, my wife, for her input on all that I write here, and for her consistent support and patience while I chase my dreams.</p> -->
