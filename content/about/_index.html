<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Brad Carruthers and I’m currently completing an <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2019/MSc-Statistics-Research" target="_blank">MSc Statistics (Research)</a> degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science. You’re welcome to have a look at my <a href="/img/carruthers-cv-10-03-2019.pdf" target="_blank">cv</a>, my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-carruthers-7b737190/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> and you might also want to have a look at what I’ve been doing on <a href="https://github.com/BCallumCarr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I started this blog in January 2019, so it is most likely still a bit barren. My plan is to populate it with things that I’m currently doing and that I’m interested in. Speaking of things I’m interested in: I enjoy surfing, teaching, public speaking, travelling and I’m passionate about helping solve challenges in developing countries and globally - inequality, chronic poverty, <a href="https://www.privacytools.io" target="_blank">online privacy</a> and the implications of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond" target="_blank">fourth industrial revolution</a> are currently at the top of my list.</p>
<p>I have experience as an investment analyst, an Economics lecturer (<a href="http://www.sun.ac.za/english" target="_blank">Stellenbosch University</a> in South Africa) and a Mathematics teaching assistant (also Stellenbosch University). Recently, I’ve worked as both an Academic Manager and Data Science teaching assistant at <a href="http://ixperience.co.za" target="_blank">iXperience</a>, an innovative EdTech company based in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
<p>Feel free to pop a mail to my school address: <a href="mailto:b.c.carruthers@lse.ac.uk">b{dot}c{dot}carruthers{at}lse{dot}ac{dot}uk</a> to ask about anything related to what you read here. Last but definitely not least, I thank my wife Bronwyn for not only for her input on all that I write here, but for her consistent support and patience in me chasing my dreams.</p>
