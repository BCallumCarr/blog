<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Brad Carruthers and I’m currently a Master’s student at the London School of Economics and Political Science. <a href="/img/carruthers-cv-18-01-2019.pdf">Here</a> is my cv, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-carruthers-7b737190/">here</a> is my LinkedIn profile and you might also want to have a look at what I’ve been doing on <a href="https://github.com/BCallumCarr">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I started this blog in January 2019, so it most likely is still a little barren. My plan is to populate it with things that I’m currently doing and that I’m interested in. Speaking of things I’m interested in: I enjoy surfing, teaching, public speaking and exploring solutions to (particularly education) problems around the world.</p>
<p>I have experience as an investment analyst, an Economics lecturer (<a href="http://www.sun.ac.za/english">Stellenbosch University</a> in South Africa) and a Mathematics teaching assistant (also Stellenbosch University). Recently, I’ve worked as both an Academic Manager and Data Science teaching assistant at <a href="http://ixperience.co.za">iXperience</a>, an innovative EdTech company based in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
<p>I am passionate about helping solve challenges in developing countries and globally - inequality, chronic poverty, <a href="https://www.privacytools.io">online privacy</a>, and the implications of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond">fourth industrial revolution</a> are currently at the top of my list.</p>
<p>Feel free to pop a mail to my school address: <a href="mailto:b.c.carruthers@lse.ac.uk">b{dot}c{dot}carruthers{at}lse{dot}ac{dot}uk</a></p>
