Hi there!

My name is Brad Carruthers and I'm currently a Master's student at the London School of Economics and Political Science. [Here](/img/carruthers-cv-18-01-2019.pdf) is my cv, [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-carruthers-7b737190/) is my LinkedIn profile and you might also want to have a look at what I've been doing on [GitHub](https://github.com/BCallumCarr).

I started this blog in January 2019, so apologies if it looks a little barren. My plan is to be very diligent about populating it with things that I'm currently doing and that I'm interested in. Speaking of things I'm interested in: I enjoy surfing, teaching, public speaking and exploring solutions to (specifically education) problems around the world.

I have experience as an investment analyst, an Economics lecturer and a Mathematics teaching assistant at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. I've also recently worked as both a Academic Manager and Data Science teaching assistant at [iXperience](http://ixperience.co.za), an innovative EdTech company based in Cape Town, South Africa.

I am passionate about solving education, poverty and inequality challenges in developing countries and this is what I hope to work on throughout and after my Masters in Statistics at LSE.
