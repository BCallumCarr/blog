<h3>MSc Thesis at LSE - Nudging Online Users Into Asking “Better” Questions</h3>
<p>So after bouncing around quite a bit, I’ve settled on a topic for my thesis at LSE. My aim is to investigate a way to help users identify whether their online questions have a high or low chance of being answered in a constructive way. The various <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#questions" target="_blank">StackExchange</a> fora provide a neat set of large datasets to play with (see <a href="https://archive.org/download/stackexchange" target="_blank">here</a> for the data dump), and it doesn’t appear to difficult to use data on historial questions and answers to predict some kind of “quality” inherent in questions - i.e. as in <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/viewFile/8080/8143" target="_blank">Ravi <em>et al.</em> (2014)</a>.</p>
<p>Ravi <em>et al.</em> (2014) basically use the text of StackOverflow questions to predict their score (upvotes minus downvotes) within the StackOverflow community. They manage to achieve 72% classification accuracy, beating the 60% accuracy if only page-views (i.e. popularity) are used for prediction. Since my aim is to inform users of whether their question will illicit a productive response from a community, I am considering other response variables like the number of edits a question undergoes and the sentiment of comments/answers…</p>
