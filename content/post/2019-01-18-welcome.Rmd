### Welcome to my personal website

I started this blog-type project in January 2019 to jot down my thoughts and current research ideas. Have a look at my [About](https://bradcarruthers.netlify.com/about/) section for some more information on what I'm up to, my [Research](https://bradcarruthers.netlify.com/projects/) section for projects I am working on, or my first posts:

* [Experimenting with StackOverflow](https://bradcarruthers.netlify.com/2019/03/08/annoying-the-stackoverflow-community-for-research/)
* [Becoming a super user](https://bradcarruthers.netlify.com/2019/03/09/become-a-super-user)
* [Taking control of your digital privacy](https://bradcarruthers.netlify.com/2019/03/10/your-digital-privacy-matters/).
