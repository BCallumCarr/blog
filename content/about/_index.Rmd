Hi there!

My name is Brad Carruthers and I'm currently completing an [MSc Statistics (Research)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2019/MSc-Statistics-Research) degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science. [Here](/img/carruthers-cv-18-01-2019.pdf) is my cv, [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-carruthers-7b737190/) is my LinkedIn profile and you might also want to have a look at what I've been doing on [GitHub](https://github.com/BCallumCarr).

I started this blog in January 2019, so it is most likely still a bit barren. My plan is to populate it with things that I'm currently doing and that I'm interested in. Speaking of things I'm interested in: I enjoy surfing, teaching, public speaking, travelling and I'm passionate about helping solve challenges in developing countries and globally - inequality, chronic poverty, [online privacy](https://www.privacytools.io) and the implications of the [fourth industrial revolution](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond) are currently at the top of my list.

I have experience as an investment analyst, an Economics lecturer ([Stellenbosch University](http://www.sun.ac.za/english) in South Africa) and a Mathematics teaching assistant (also Stellenbosch University). Recently, I've worked as both an Academic Manager and Data Science teaching assistant at [iXperience](http://ixperience.co.za), an innovative EdTech company based in Cape Town, South Africa.

Feel free to pop a mail to my school address: [b{dot}c{dot}carruthers{at}lse{dot}ac{dot}uk](mailto:b.c.carruthers@lse.ac.uk) to ask about anything related to what you read here. Last but definitely not least, I thank my wife Bronwyn for not only for her input on all that I write here, but for her consistent support and patience in me chasing my dreams.
