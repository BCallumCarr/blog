<h3>So I finally asked my first question on StackOverflow</h3>
<p>Judging by the community’s reaction, it did not go well:</p>

<p>Hopefully you might guess that, although it really was me who asked this (using an anonymous StackOverflow account), I actually intended for it to be extremely broad, under-researched and less-than-perfectly-legible - i.e. a poor question. I’ve been thinking quite a bit about questions lately: what makes them “good”, what makes them “bad” and how to assist users in asking better ones in online communities such as <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites#questions" target="_blank">StackExchange sites</a> or Massive Open Online Courses.</p>
<p>I’ve always had the opinion that, at least in a classroom and educational setting, there is really no such thing as a silly question. Questions from students to teacher in any environment signify some level of engagement from the students’ side, no matter how broad or relevant. Online though, the focus tends to be more on the brute-force retrieval of answers where the forum serves as a “two-sided market” with someone needing a resource (i.e. expert advice) being matched up with someone offering this resource.</p>
<p>I think few online communities demonstrate this illustration more so than <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank>StackOverflow</a>, which formally describes itself as a “Q&amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers” but inherently serves more as a global debugging platform. Countless computer coding errors and niggly programming issues are queried on a daily basis (17 million questions and counting), and this has evidently led to the community trying to filter out “bad” questions:</p>

<p>On platforms where these expert resources may be scarce (MOOC forums are a good example), it might help if there was a system to advise question-askers on how likely their question will be answered productively, espeically when the community (and the asker) values concrete answers delivered hastily rather than broader discussions and the asker is querying a specific problem rather than looking to enhance their knowledge on a subject substantially. Interesting topic for a MSc thesis wouldn’t you say?</p>
