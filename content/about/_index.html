<p>One is not born into the world to do everything but to do something. – Henry David Thoreau</p>
<p>Welcome</p>
<p>My name is Brad and I’ll shortly be graduating my <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2019/MSc-Statistics-Research" target="_blank">MSc Statistics (Research)</a> degree at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Here is my <a href="/img/bcarruthers-cv-21-09-2019.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>, my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-carruthers-7b737190/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> and a link to what I’ve been doing on <a href="https://github.com/BCallumCarr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>My plan is to populate this blog with things that I’m currently doing and that I’m interested in. Speaking of things I’m interested in: offline I spend my time surfing, teaching, public speaking, <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com" target="blank_">playing Dungeons and Dragons</a> and travelling.</p>
<p>I have experience as an <a href="http://www.securewealth.co.za" target="_blank">investment analyst</a>, an Economics lecturer (at <a href="http://www.sun.ac.za/english" target="_blank">Stellenbosch University</a> in South Africa) and recently I was an Academic Manager and taught Data Science at <a href="http://ixperience.co.za" target="_blank">iXperience</a>, an innovative EdTech company based in Cape Town.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about education, <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/classic/" target="_blank">digital privacy</a> and the implications of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond" target="_blank">fourth industrial revolution</a>. You can use the following email address to get a hold of me: <a href="mailto:brad@securewealth.co.za">brad{at}securewealth{dot}co{dot}za</a>.</p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, I must thank Bronwyn, my wife, for her input on all that I write here, and for her consistent support and patience while I chase my dreams.</p>
