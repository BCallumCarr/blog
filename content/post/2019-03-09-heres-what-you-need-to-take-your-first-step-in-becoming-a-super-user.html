<p>I really do think that information overload is becoming an increasingly ubiqutous and burdensome problem in the developed world, and you’ll see that the lack of information/clutter/applications on both screens of my two devices illustrate necessity rather than convenience. I do know you’re itching to get to the Super User-y lifehacks, so the last thing I’ll say about this is how my aim has been to eliminate <a href="https://highexistence.com/internet-attention-economy/">digital distractions</a> and increase focus in my digital life.</p>
<p>So, onto Super User lifehacks. One reason I can afford to have nothing on my laptop’s desktop most of the time is how I have learned to move around computers (irrespective of whether it’s a Windows, Apple or Linux operating system). To sum this up in pictures, I have basically made these two things my mortal enemies:</p>
<p><img src="/img/mac-trackpad.jpg" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /><img src="/img/pc-mouse.jpg" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>My goal has been to increase my repertoire of keyboard shortcuts (think copy-pasting with cmd-c/ctrl-c), and no doubt these small tricks continue to save me countless hours a month given the amount of time I spend on my laptop and how far I’ve improved my moving around a computer. Let’s start out slowly - I’ll give you the Mac shortcuts with Windows equivalents in brackets as far as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>tab</code> (or <code>alt</code>-<code>tab</code> on Windows) will literally change your life. Seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gone will the days be where you spend what feels like 4 hours moving through those little icons at the bottom of your screen, trying to find the last Excel sheet you were working on. Holding the <code>cmd</code> (or <code>alt</code> on Windows) key and tapping the <code>tab</code> key gives you the lightning fast capability of cycling through the open applications on your computer. Cycling through <strong>everything</strong> you have open on a Mac is a bit more nuanced (cycling through multiple windows in say Finder requires you to press <code>cmd</code>-<code>`</code>), but if there is one thing you would want to nail, it is this.</p>
<p>Combining the above trick with this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>space</code> (<code>windows</code> key on Windows)</li>
</ul>
<p>and you instantly become a super user demi-god. <code>cmd</code>-<code>space</code> on Mac opens Spotlight Search which can literally be used to do anything on a Mac, from opening applications to searching your entire computer for <strong>any</strong> file (believe it, it’s true). On a Windows system hitting the <code>windows</code> key opens up the start menu where you are also able to (somewhat more slowly) search for files or open programs.</p>
<p>Just think about what you can now already do with these two nuggets - you don’t have to spend decades wandering through Documents folders to find that picture your gran has been rashing you for months, and you don’t have to spend centuries double clicking icons left, right and center haphazardly around your computer. You can now boast beautiful, empty desktop screens like mine above, drunk on the power that you can now navigate around your computer without even touching the mouse or trackpad.</p>
<p>You can also give yourself a bit of extra space on your screen (extra nice for 13&quot; screens) by hiding icon bars and cheekily having only 6-7 icons in Mac docks:</p>

<p>So having now implemented these two small tricks, you have saved yourself plenty of time whenever you climb onto a computer. The next step is to look at the applications/programs you use the most everyday, and begin investing some time in avoiding trackpads/mice to save yourself even more. Here are the shortcuts that correspond to what I use most.</p>
<p><u>Internet Browser (and basically any other application on your computer worth it’s salt)</u></p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>t</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>t</code>) opens a new tab</li>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>t</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>t</code>) reopens the last tab you closed (you’ll see the friendly shift button coming up whenever you want to reverse something)</li>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>1</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>1</code>) swaps to your <strong>first</strong> open tab</li>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>9</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>9</code>) swaps to your <strong>last</strong> open tab</li>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>[</code> and <code>cmd</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>]</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>tab</code> and <code>ctrl</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>tab</code>) swaps to left and right tabs respectively. This is an interesting one because these specific shortcuts tend to be different across operating systems and across internet browsers (and there are also a couple different ways to do this). These are specifically my preferred shortcuts in Mac/Windows</li>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>l</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>l</code>) takes you to the search bar which becomes extremely handy any time you want to move off the current page and have some idea of the url you want to go to)</li>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>n</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>n</code>) or <code>cmd</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>p</code> in Firefox if you want to open an incognito tab, which you may think of doing more regularly after <a href="https://bradcarruthers.netlify.com/2019/03/09/your-digital-privacy-matters">taking back some control of your digital privacy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Mac Finder or Windows File Explorer</u></p>
<p>Here the differences between Mac and Windows get pretty niggly, but again if you spend the time to get comfortable with the shortcuts for your operating system you will thank your past-self immensely.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>arrow keys</code> will allow you to move around the Mac Finder, with <code>cmd</code>-<code>down arrow</code> even allowing you to open files etc. On Windows you will need to use a combination of the <code>enter</code>/<code>return</code> key and <code>alt</code>-<code>arrow keys</code></li>
<li>the usual suspects for copy-pasting files: <code>cmd</code>-<code>c</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>c</code>) for copying and <code>cmd</code>-<code>v</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>v</code>) for pasting. Two things to note here: A) this works almost universally, so copy-pasting text in any shape or form will now be a breeze, and B) if you want to <strong>cut</strong> and paste then for Mac users you’ll have to use <code>cmd</code>-<code>c</code> and then <code>cmd</code>-<code>alt</code>-<code>v</code> to move the file in Finder instead of duplicating it.</li>
<li>last but not least I give you the ability to time travel and correct all the mistakes you’ve made in your life (just joking only that one mistake you just made typing an email to your gran): <code>cmd</code>-<code>z</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>z</code>). Again, this works pretty much universally, allowing you to undo files/text you’ve just incorrectly moved/deleted, and if you make a mistake undoing your mistake (mistake-ception), you can redo what you just undo-ed with <code>cmd</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>z</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>shift</code>-<code>z</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Miscellaneous</u></p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmd</code>-<code>f</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>f</code>) to change the way you find text and keywords on webpages/pdfs etc.</li>
<li><code>alt</code>-<code>left/right arrowkeys</code> (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>left/right arrowkeys</code>) to change the way you navigate while typing text <strong>anywhere</strong> on your computer. PS: Did you know you can create a <code>delete</code> key on Mac? Just use <code>fn</code>-<code>backspace</code>. You can also skip to the beginning and end of lines of text using <code>cmd</code>-<code>left arrow</code> and <code>cmd</code>-<code>right arrow</code> (essentially the same as <code>home</code> and <code>end</code> keys on Windows).</li>
</ul>
<p>Well I hope this has given a taste of the awesomeness you could embody while whizzing around your laptop, impressing your work colleagues with your 150% increase in productivity and time-saving skills. Again, let me stress that keyboard shortcuts tend to carry across programs and applications (and operating systems). There are so many more that are out there that I haven’t mentioned here, so start Googling (or better <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo-ing</a>) more shortcuts and you will be well on your way to becoming a Super User ninja.</p>
