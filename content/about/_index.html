<p><center>Welcome</center></p>

<p>I'm Brad and I'm using this website to share some guided meditations and mindfulness sessions. Why mindfulness? Well, because it's been shown to be <a href="https://blog.mindfulness.com/meditation/benefits-of-mindfulness" target="_blank">immensely helpful in dealing with life's suffering and stresses</a> and personally I found this true for me. What value do I specifically have to add? In my experience of mindfulness, someone's voice and the way they convey their message often just resonates with certain people, and so I hope that this is the case for you :) Also, it helps me actually regularly practice because <b>sitting down for 10 minutes to be mindful a day is so flippen difficult</b>. But really, being mindful is one of the hardest things you will do - so let's get to it!</p>

<p>Here is a short introduction:</p>

<p>And here is a little bit more about me.</p>

Any work-related stuff you can find on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-carruthers-7b737190/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, and there are still some (outdated) things on my <a href="https://github.com/BCallumCarr" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
